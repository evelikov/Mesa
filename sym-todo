wl generated symbols (egl, gbm, vulkan) - depends on wayland-scanner, can workaround locally - see libva
wl - overlinking what is client and what is server

egl 1.5 symbols - ABI/API - Chad, Marek
test we don't break the OpenGL interop again - Marek

wayland-egl -> move the backend ABI to wayland

i965 -> the compiler move - test
general tests -> check all symbols (_/__ as well?) alike libdrm


promote visib to generic cflags - drop elsewhere
move the srcdir/inc to svga -> kill the custom one
promote drv/winsys to generic -> kill others



vc4 is broken ....


kill the winsys symbols - ilia to test vdpau? someone for xinerama?

check - xa opencl (with and w/o lloader) deprecate w/o loalder?
